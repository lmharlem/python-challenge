### This Python script will analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

-The total number of months included in the dataset

-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

-Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

-The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

-The final script will both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results

- An example of what the analysis should will look like is shown below:

Vote Counting

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote.

As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 3521001
-------------------------
Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
Correy: 20.000% (704200)
Li: 14.000% (492940)
O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
-------------------------
Winner: Khan
-------------------------
In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
