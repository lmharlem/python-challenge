### This Python script will analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

 -Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

 -The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

 -The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

 -The final script will both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results

 - An example of what the analysis should will look like is shown below:
