### This Python script will analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  - The total number of months included in the dataset

  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  - Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

  - The final script will both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results

  - An example of what the analysis will look like is shown below:
